 I am a female computational scientist with extensive experiences on the development of atmospheric models for climate and air quality applications. 
 
 I was an assistant professor at Washington State University and a visiting faculty at Center for Advanced Systems Understanding, HZDR in Germany, leading a group that works on various air quality modeling tools and machine learning application. Prior to that, I worked at NASA GISS and Duke University where my work focused on developing a global climate-chemistry model and science-driven decision support for climate/energy policies. Besides theses, I am also interested in contributing to open science and data science projects and providing career and life advices to grad students and early career scientist.
